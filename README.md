# Emotion-Aware Virtual Listener

A web-based application that transcribes user speech, detects emotions (mock implementation), and provides empathetic responses to support emotional well-being. Built for a hackathon to demonstrate real-time speech processing and UI design.

## Features
- **Speech-to-Text**: Captures user speech via a microphone button (currently uses a mock implementation, with Web Speech API integration available).
- **Transcript Display**: Shows the transcribed text in a clean, readable format.
- **Empathetic Responses**: Generates supportive responses based on the transcript (mock emotion detection).
- **Responsive UI**: Styled with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with Lucide Icons for a modern look.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

- **Speech Processing**: Mock implementation (Web Speech API for real-time transcription in Chrome)
